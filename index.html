        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Give content structure  via “elements”</li>
          <li>Element and tag are often used interchangeably element usually refers to everything inside opening and closing tags, whereas tag refers only to what's inside angle brackets </li>
          <li>Attributes define additional information about an element (always defined at opening of element)</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive </li>
          <li> head element = container for Metadata (info ~ title, accessibility, search engines, and performance but not seen by user)</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements (ie the parent element) are called child elements </li>
          <li>h1-h6 should be done in order for accessibility reasons and h1 only used once</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is done with the style attribute to change the style of a single element</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains full CSS rules contained in the “style” element inside the head element</li>
          <li>External style sheet is separate from the html code and uses the “link” element inside the head element</li>
          <li>Selector indicates what element in the html the declarations will apply to</li>
          <li>Declarations consist of a property and the value of that property you want to apply</li>
          <li>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code means two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together to reduce overall size and complexity of base code</li>
